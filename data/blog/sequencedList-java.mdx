title: 'The Latest Features in Java 21 - Sequenced Collection'

draft: true
summary: Introducing Java's new sequenced interface designed to represent collections with a defined encounter order. Each collection in this interface has a clearly defined first element, which is followed in a specific sequence up to the last element. Additionally, it offers a uniform set of APIs for retrieving the first and last elements, along with processing the elements in reverse order.

### Motivation
Java's `Collection` framework lacks a `Collection` type that represents a sequence of elements with a  defined encouner order. it also lacks a uniquor set of
operations that apply across such `Collection`s. These gaps have been repeated source of problems and complaints. 

For example, `List` and `Deque` both define an encounter order but their common supertype is `Collection`,
which does not. Similarly, `Set` does not define an encounter order, and subtypes such as `HashSet` do not define one,
but subtypes such as `SortedSet` and `LinkedHashSet` do. Support for encounter order is thus spread across the type hierarchy,
making it difficult to express certain useful concepts in APIs. 
Neither `Collection` nor List can describe a parameter or return value that has an encounter order. 
`Collection` is too general, relegating such constraints to the prose specification, 
possibly leading to hard-to-debug errors. List is too specific, excluding SortedSet and LinkedHashSet.

A related problem is that view collections are often forced to downgrade to weaker semantics. 
Wrapping a LinkedHashSet with `Collections::unmodifiableSet` yields a Set, discarding the information about encounter order.

Without interfaces to define them, operations related to encounter order are either inconsistent or missing. 
While many implementations support getting the first or last element, each collection defines its own way, 
and some are not obvious or are missing entirely:

    |               | Retrieving first element      | Retrieving last element      |
    |---------------| ---------------------------   | ---------------------------- |
    List            | list.get(0)                   | list.get(list.size()-1)      |
    LinkedHashSet   | linkedHashSet.iterator().next | doesn't exist                |
    SortedSet       | sortedSet.first()             | sortedSet.last()             |
    Deque           | deque.getFirst()              | deque.getLast()              |

Some operations, such as obtaining the last element of a List, are unnecessarily complex, and others, 
like retrieving the last element of a LinkedHashSet, require full iteration through the set - a process that is not straightforward. 
These limitations have consistently led to technical challenges.
