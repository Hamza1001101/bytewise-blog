## Welcome to my blog

Hey There!👋🏽

Welcome to my digital construction zone! This site is a bit like my living room – always under some kind of renovation and probably never truly finished. But hey, I promise to keep adding bells, whistles, and maybe a few gizmos here and there as time ticks on. Stick around for the never-ending adventure, and who knows, maybe one day we'll even have virtual snacks!

This project is using the following technologies
> - Next js
> - Tailwind
