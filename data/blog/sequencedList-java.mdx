title: 'Mastering Queues in JavaScript: Array vs. LinkedList'
date: '2024-01-14'
tags: ['Javascript', 'queues', 'data structure', 'algorithms']
draft: true
summary: Implementing queues in JavaScript offers multiple paths, primarily using a combination of built-in, higher-level methods like push, pop, shift and unshift. While convenient, you should note that shift and unshift can lead to performance drawbacks for large datasets, as they reindex the entire list, which can have some tangible effects, especially in data-intensive applications.
